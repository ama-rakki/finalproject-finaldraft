            <h3>Sticker brands and their aesthetics</h3>
            <img src="../images/sticker-triangle.png" style="background: transparent;">
            <p>When I browse the sticker aisle of my favorite stationary stores, I often notice 4 big brands:<a href="#sanrio"> Sanrio</a>,
                <a href="#san-x"> San-x</a>, <a href="#miffy"> Miffy</a>, and<a href="#tokidoki"> Tokidoki</a>. I want to give more of a background into the history of the companies, how
                or why they dominate the sticker aisle, and give my opinion on each of the brand’s aesthetics. </p>
        </div>

            <h3 id="sanrio">Sanrio</h3>
            <img src="../images/sanrio-characters.jpg" style="display:block; float: right; width:70%">
            <p>Starting in order of popularity (in my opinion) is <a href="https://www.sanrio.com/"
                    target="_blank">Sanrio</a>. Many know Sanrio through their superstar Hello Kitty and friends.
                Created in 1960s Japan, Sanrio began as Yamanashi Silk Company and didn’t start debuting characters till
                1973 with their creation of <a href="https://hellokitty.fandom.com/wiki/Coro_Chan" target="_blank"> Coro Chan</a>
            then in 1974 with Hello Kitty. Today, Sanrio specializes in a variety of products such as toys, plushies,
            video games, fashion, gifts, and of course stationary. Sanrio now has a lineup of about <b>450 characters</b>,
            making marketing and product release a breeze. In stores today the most commonly found characters to market
            are Hello Kitty, Cinnamoroll, Pompompurin, Kuromi, Kerropi, and My Melody. Because marketing for Sanrio is
            so abundant currently, I almost always find something of theirs I like. However, I find their American
            designs to differ too greatly to their Japanese designs. Sanrio products in Japan feature more muted colors
            and subtle patterns while Sanrio products made for America have brighter colors. Needless to say, Sanrio’s
            team of adorable mascots is what makes the brand so popular today in many forms of media. </p>

            <h3 id="san-x">San-X</h3>
            <img src="../images/sanx-characters.jpg" style="display:block; float: right; width:70%">
            <p><a href="https://www.san-x.jp/">San-X</a> is another Japanese company that started out as only producing generic stationary originally under the name Chida Handler. It wasn’t until 1973 the company became San-X and began experimenting with scenic patterns and even a few illustrations. Only in 1987 did they debut their first character: <a href="https://san-xcharacters.fandom.com/wiki/Pinny_Mu">Pinny-Mu</a>, a small brown panda that graced products like notebooks, pencils, and even glassware. Currently, San-X’s most popular characters are <a href="https://san-xcharacters.fandom.com/wiki/Rilakkuma_Franchise"> Rilakkuma</a>, <a href="https://san-xcharacters.fandom.com/wiki/Sumikko_Gurashi?so=search"> Sumikko, Gurashi</a>, and <a href="https://san-xcharacters.fandom.com/wiki/Corocoro_Coronya?so=search"> Corocoro Coronya</a>. Despite the smaller roster of characters, I generally like San-X stickers more than that of Sanrio. Maybe because they don’t alter their domestic designs like Sanrio does, I find the colors and designs of San-X to be more delicate and softer. Many people confuse the two companies and understandably so! But San-X and Sanrio have no affiliation and, in my opinion, are pretty silent competitors. </p>

            <h3 id="miffy">Miffy</h3>
            <img src="../images/Miffy.png" style="display:block; float: right; width:40%; background: transparent;" >
            <p>I was first introduced to Miffy in 2019 on a trip to the Netherlands, my sister and I got matching keychains of the bunny to add to our luggage in the Amsterdam Airport. Miffy the character was created by Dick Bruna in the Netherlands circa 1955 and has since become popular through children’s books and animated shows. However currently Miffy has taken over more popular media, being featured in modern art museums like the <a href="https://store.moma.org/collections/miffy-friends-designs"> MoMA </a> and collaborating with popular brands like <a href="https://www.mulberry.com/us/miffy"> Mulberry</a>, <a href="https://www.baccarat.com/en_us/creations/collaborations/miffy.html"> Baccarat</a>, and <a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/products/E459564-000/00?colorDisplayCode=61&sizeDisplayCode=003"> Uniqlo</a>. With her newfound popularity, Miffy is steadily incorporating herself into stationary products as well, currently I only own a couple Miffy stamps and a few stickers, but I can’t wait to see her pop-up on the shelves more often.</p>
            <p>I often see people confuse Miffy for a Japanese brand, her likeness and design similar to that of Hello Kitty. Interestingly enough, there has been a legal dispute between these two companies resulting in the early retirement of a Sanrio character.

            <h3 id="tokidoki">Tokidoki</h3>
            <img src="../images/tokidokicover.png" style="display:block; float: right; width:70%; " >
            <p>Tokidoki was created in 2006 by Italian artist Simone Legno, whose work is heavily influenced by Japanese pop culture, manga, and anime. His art expresses a more vibrant, kitschy, and campy feel compared to innocent and cutesy brands such as San-X.<a href="https://www.tokidoki.it/collections/tokidoki-x-hello-kitty"> Tokidoki has actually done many collabs with Sanrio.</a> It’s probably thanks to their considerably different character designs that they can collab without confusing consumers too much. I appreciate the boldness of the Tokidoki brand, it’s refreshing to see a funkier, punk design when so many other companies choose to portray an overly childish form of cute. </p>
