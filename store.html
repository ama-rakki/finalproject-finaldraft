            <p>Located about an hour away from my hometown is my favorite Daiso in Californias Bay Area. Daiso is a
                Japanese franchise similar to American dollar stores. Daiso locations in America feature Japanese
                imports from kitchen ware to skin care, and most importantly: stationary! Daiso stores carry a variety
                of popular sticker brands, they have a great selection of washi tapes, and useful tools like compact
                scissors and paper cutters. I always leave Daiso with at least a couple pages of stickers and a new
                washi tape roll. </p>

            <p>Chattanooga is a lovely city located in southeastern Tennessee right along the Tennessee river and on the
                boarder of Georgia. I got to know the area well during a summer research position at their university
                (UTC department of Computer Science and Engineering). When exploring the city, I was not expecting to
                find I Go Tokyo, a Japanese import store. Their shop contained fabulous products from Japan like teas
                sets, bento boxes, language books, and of course stationary! The curation of this store was unique, and
                the atmosphere was welcoming, if you ever find yourself in Chattanooga Tennessee be sure to check it
                out! </p>

            </div>
            <p>Kinokuniya is another Japanese store specializing in books as well as other Japanese imports. I always
                visit their NYC location whenever I am in the area to check out their new selection of stickers and
                pens. I love this location because it is three stories and has a great selection of manga and Japanese
                translated literature! The basement level of this store is where all the stationary is held, their pen
                displays are amazing for a bookstore and even feature ink refills and customizable pens! </p>
