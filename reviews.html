            <h3>My first Zebra MildLiner Highlighters </h3>

            <h4 style="text-indent: 5%;">Author: Nariz </h4>

            <a target="_blank" href="https://tokyopenshop.com/products/zebra-limited-edition-mildliner-25-color-set">
                <img src="images/mildliners.jpg" style="width: 60%;" class="center hover-image">
                <figcaption>Zebra Limited Edition Mildliner 25 Set</figcaption>
            </a>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">When I first started getting into stationary as a studious high-schooler with
                social media, the Zebra
                MildLiner Highlighters were one of the first items I bought to start my pen collection. The minimalist
                palette and dual pen design reflected the aesthetics of 2015, and so all my Pinterest board inspirations
                and saved Instagram posts included the pastel colorings of these highlighters. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">For those who aren’t familiar, <a
                    style="color: #946656; text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.zebrapen.com/">Zebra</a> is a Japanese pen company that offers a
                variety of writing
                instruments. Their MildLiner brand markets their pends for use in “bullet journals, planners, study
                notes, schedules, and creative projects”. As of 2024, their selection of
                highlighters includes 35 different colors ranging multiple shades of the rainbow. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">My first highlighter set from Zebra was the Zebra Limited Edition MildLiner 25
                Color Set, which I
                received for Christmas and swatched immediately. I mostly used the double-ended highlighter feature to
                go over my notes, and occasionally used the dual-tip brush pen to doodle or outline illustrations.
                Something I have grown accustomed to after years of trying out different pens is gauging their ability
                to smear ink or bleed through paper. I find this the minimum a good pen can avoid doing. On standard
                <a style="color: #946656; text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.doxdirect.com/help/what-size-is-a4-paper/">A4 paper</a>, these highlighters do not
                bleed through. However I found on bounded pages like notebooks,
                which
                have an undistinguishably thinner page, they can bleed through on occasion depending on the force of the
                pen. Additionally, while the soft pastel colors is what typically draws most people to these sets, I
                found some shades are too light to be noticeable, <a style="color: #946656; text-decoration:underline;"
                    target="_blank" href="https://www.zebrapen.com/pages/discover-mildliner">specifically the classic
                    Yellow shade. </a>
            </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">Since I received my first set of MildLiners (about 6 years ago) I have probably
                gone through 2 or 3
                packs. While I do have slight criticisms, I cannot deny that these pens make an excellent staple for
                those seeking hints of color across their journal pages. Their color palette is what keeps me coming
                back. Compared to the harsh neon’s of other highlighters on the market, I find solace in the simple,
                sleek, and quieter colors of the Zebra MildLiner Highlighters.</p>

            <h3>Intro to Washi-tapes with the ZDOLAKIDS 100 Washi Tape set </h3>
            <h4 style="text-indent: 5%;">Author: Amara </h4>

            </a>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">After becoming more comfortable with buying and testing items from different
                stationary brands, I was
                still reluctant to venture into new things. I had a growing pen collection, but I knew the stationary
                world had more to offer than just ink. So in 2021 I purchased my first set of washi tapes. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;"> Washi tape originates from the use and designs of Japanese washi paper used for
                origami and other
                traditional paper crafts of the country. <a style="color: #946656; text-decoration:underline;"
                    target="_blank" href="https://konmari.com/guide-to-washi-tape/">Washi tape was conceived in 2006
                </a>when it was discovered that
                sticky adhesive papers are popular mediums for bookmaking . Since then, washi tapes have become a
                staple in any stationary collection. With different customizations like colors, patterns, icons, and
                text, washi tapes are an easy way to customize any paper project. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;"> To start my washi tape collection, I decided to go big and order a 100-piece
                set <a style="color: #946656; text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.washitape.com.cn/images/uploaded/%E7%83%AB%E9%87%91/2020%E5%B9%B4-%E8%B0%A6%E8%AF%9A%E8%AF%A6%E6%83%85%E6%A8%A1%E7%89%88-English-%E5%88%87%E7%89%87%E5%95%86%E5%9F%8E_02.jpeg">(most
                    washi tapes are 0.5 – 3.0 cm in width)</a>. I made sure to find a set with a variety of designs I
                saw myself using, this led
                me to the “Kawaii Washi Tape Set” provided by the ZDOLAKIDS brand on Amazon. With decent reviews and a
                cheap price per-roll, I made the first step into a washi world. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;"> These tapes are fun and colorful, with color specific patterns spanning from
                red to purple, I especially
                liked how the variety was organized by color. I find that every roll of tape is equally adhesive, so no
                dry tapes that need extra gluing. I also like how the colors aren’t dull and the images aren’t
                pixilated, only fresh crisp patterns and cute designs. Since I have purchased this set about 3 years
                ago, I have yet to complete a single roll. Each roll is of substantial length, and I anticipate using
                these rolls for a while more. </p>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;"> My first set of washi-tapes was a great experience and introduced me into the
                happy medium of adhesive
                papers, I use them to decorate my journal pages, or even to cut our specific patterns and use as
                stickers <a style="color: #946656; text-decoration:underline;" target="_blank" href="https://ama-rakki.github.io/finalproject/images/leadimage.jpg">(like the image on my home page!)</a>. I highly recommend this product if you like the selection of designs they provide and have a
                journal needing fun illustrations. </p>
