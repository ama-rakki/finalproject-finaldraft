            <h3>History of StickerBug</h3>
            <img src="images/logo1.png" style=" float:left; display: block; width: 30%; background: transparent;" />
            <p>StickerBug was founded during 2020 quarantine era and has been updating ever since. Dedicated to
                journaling (especially junk journaling) StickerBug features product reviews, journal inspiration, and a
                creative community that encourages expression through paper and cute stationary. The StickerBug team
                hopes to provide a space for all journal hobbyists, from beginners to experienced creators. We look
                forward to continuing on our own creative journey, so expect more content and collaborations from us in
                the near future!</p>

            <h3>Director</h3>
            <p> Hello, my name is Amara. I am the creator and director of StickerBug. But I am also a student, reader,
                runner, gamer, and photographer. I created StickerBug to catalog and share my favorite stationary
                products. I want to make a community for those who love to journal. I first started journaling during
                2020 Quarantine. One day I was flipping through a travel magazine I found when I started cutting out
                shapes, images, and whole pages I liked. I started a scrapbook of sorts with discarded images like
                these. To this day I collect all sorts of "junk", from tags, receipts, wrappers, and mail just to glue
                into my junk journal. </p>

            <h3>Directors Assistant</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Nariz. I work as the Directors Assistant for StickerBug. I am a sporty fellow who likes
                soccer, running, and underwater hockey. I became interested in journaling as a way to keep track of my
                weightlifting and health goals. Since then I have enjoyed finding new ways to decorate my journal pages
                (I find this practice gives me improved results in the gym). My everyday work as a part of StickerBug
                includes making coffee for the boss, cutting apples for the boss, and cleaning the office (for the
                boss). </p>

            <h3>Assistant Director</h3>
            <p>Hello my name is Hamtaro, my role for StickerBug is Assistant Director. This means I do exactly what the
                Director does but I get paid less. I am not particularly a fan of journaling, but as a Hamster I love to
                eat paper so I often get caught in the supply room eating stickers. In my free time I love to run on my
                wheel and nap.</p>
